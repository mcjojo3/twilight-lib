# Twilight Lib

Twilight Lib is a library mod used by mc_jojo3's mods. It is designed to more easily allow synchronization and compatibility between my different mods and is in no way meant to be used in other ways. If anyone (which I doubt) finds this mod useful for other purposes, feel free to use it, but it will remain closed source (without documentation, I might add) like most of my mods due to my horrendous code commenting/documentation skills.
